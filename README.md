# Playdoh - A playground for data over HTMX

Playdoh is a slightly-functional proof-of-concept for bundling a common set of Scicloj resources into a self-contained SCI context and uses the rendering components of Clay with HTMX to serve a notebook execution environment that can be used locally or accessed via a web server. 

WIP on Graal native-image build as well as CRaC
